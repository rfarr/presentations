        <h3>A Typical Day at the Office...</h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>You're working on some leet software</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Like a cool cat your using NoSQL databases to store and manipulate documents</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Or maybe you actually care about your data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You know that God intended ACID to be the only drug of choice for data</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Either way you work with CRUD everyday!</h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Uh oh, your boss walks up to you...</h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>"I want to ask you a bunch of questions, and I want to have them answered immediately!"</h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Q: "What product(s) do our customers remove from their cart within a few minutes of checking out?"</li>
          <li class="fragment">A: "Uh.. we don't have that data... we can build and deploy some code to do that within the next iteration or so, talk to my PM and we can prioritize it."</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Q: "What exactly did Mr. Snowden access between 2011 and 2012?"</li>
          <li class="fragment">A: "Uh, we'll need to trace through several hundred gigs of logs to get a gist.  Gee, we should have spent time building and maintaining an audit log!"</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Q: "One of our biggest clients just found a bug that prevented them from placing a trade for a few minutes but then it went away, can you fix it?"</li>
          <li class="fragment">A: "Can't reproduce."</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>You have all this data... why is this happening?</h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>You missed some crucial facts:</h3>
        <h2 class="fragment">State Transitions</h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Your perfectly polished data is simply an aggregate of all previous CRUD operations</h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>How, when and <b>why</b> did your data get into its current state?</h3>
        <h5 class="fragment">"Check the log?"</h5>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>You need to treat state <b>transitions</b> as your system of record, not whatever state you currently happen to be in!</h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>With event sourcing you record every single event that mutates state in an append only log</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Crucially</b> all state mutation in your program must occur as the direct result of the application of these events</li>
          <li>It's <b>not</b> an audit log, it's the actual sequence of events that when input to your program will reproduce exactly the same state everytime</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Conceptually break your program into two parts:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Decision logic - given current state and an input command, decide on a course of action as an output event.</li>
          <li>Mutation logic - given current state and an output event, apply the event to the current state to arrive at a new state.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Basic Example</h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>You are building a shopping cart app</h3>
        <ul class="fragment">
          <li>Users add items from their cart</li>
          <li>Some business logic to determine if an item can be added</li>
          <li>Show appropriate error if item not addable</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Typical CRUD</h3>
        <pre><code>sub add_item_to_cart {
  my $item = shift;

  # Check if user can add this item
  if ($some_condition) {
    # Add to in memory shopping cart
    ...

    # Also persist the user's shopping cart for later
    $dbh->do(qq{UPDATE shopping_cart SET ... });
  }

  # Couldn't add item
  die "Unable to add item: out of stock";
}
        </code></pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Event Decision</h3>
        <pre><code>sub add_item_to_cart {
    my $item = shift;

    # Determine if user can add this item
    if ($some_condition) {
      $return {
        command => 'item_added_to_cart',
        item_id => 123,
        quantity => 3,
      };
    }
    return  {
      command => 'rejected_add_item_to_cart',
      error => 'Not in stock'
    };
}
        </pre></code>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>Event Application</h3>
        <pre><code>sub item_added {
    my $event = shift;

    # Mutate in memory shopping cart
    ...
}

sub item_add_rejected {
    my $event = shift;

    # Show error message to user
    ...
}
        </pre></code>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>By decoupling the "decision" from the "action" you now have an unbroken stream of state updates that capture the entire history of execution</h3>
        <ul class="fragment">
          <li>Just looking at this stream of events is enough to reconstruct the application state at any point time.</li>
          <li class="fragment">All inputs that can modify state <b>must</b> be included: config changes, time trigger events, callouts to external systems.</li>
          <li class="fragment">Unlike homeopathy, even an atom of non-determinism means the system can enter an unedfined state.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Primary system of record is the immutable stream of events</h3>
        <ul class="fragment">
          <li>Can never "undo" or "modify".</li>
          <li>Use additional "correction" events if you need to ameloriate a broken system.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>In order to efficiently query the system you will need to aggregate events into a traditional database</h3>
        <ul class="fragment">
          <li>Allows creating specific read models based the needs of client (ie BI, Operations, Finance, etc)</li>
          <li>This "aggregate" can be dumped and rebuilt at any time if needed</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Further Thoughts</h3>
        <ul class="fragment">
          <li>How to deal with datamodel changes?</li>
          <li>Isn't that too much data?</li>
          <li>Won't it take a long time to replay all events?</li>
        </ul>
