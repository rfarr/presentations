          <h2>The Straddle</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Allows you to profit from either high volatility (long straddle) or low volatility (short straddle) no matter which way the stock moves</h3>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <ul class="fragment">
            <li>RY is currently trading at $60 and you believe that there will be movement, but you're not sure which way it will go.</li>
            <li class="fragment">You decide to employ the long straddle buying both a call option and a put option at a strike price of $60 for a cost of $2.50 per share or $250 overall.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>If RY goes down to $50 then you ignore the call and sell the put for $10 a share, netting $750 profit</h3>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>If RY goes sideways both options expires worthless and you lost $250</h3>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>If RY rises to $70 then you ignore the put and sell the call for $10 a share, netting $750 profit</h3>

      <section>
        <h3>A short straddle is similiar except you write a call and a put at $60, netting a premium of $250.  If the stock doesn't move you keep it.</h3>
