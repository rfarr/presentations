11/3/71	SYS_TIME (II)

NAME  time -- get time of year
SYNOPSIS  sys time / time = 13.

(time AC--MQ)
DESCRIPTION  time returns the time since 00:00:00, Jan. 1, 1971,
             measured in sixtieths of a second. The high order word
             is in the AC register and the low order is in the MQ.

FILES	
SEE_ALSO	
DIAGNOSTICS	
BUGS  The chronological--minded user will note that 2**32 sixtieths
      of a second is only about 2.5 years.

          <li>Internally <code>time_t</code> is a signed 32-bit integer which will overflow on Monday January 18, 2038 at 22:14:08 EST (talk about a bad start to the week!)</li>
          <li class="fragment">In order to mitigate this, most modern 64-bit system use <code>time_t</code> that is a signed 64 bit integer that will overflow some time after the heat death of the universe (<i>hopefully we'll have moved to another one by then!</i>)</li>
          <li class="fragment">In <i>2014</i>, OpenBSD 5.5 was the first major operating system to convert to 64-bit <code>time_t</code> for all versions of its operating system, including those that run on 32-bit archs</li>
          <li class="fragment">However existing 8, 16, and 32-bit systems, as well as new ones deployed <i>without</i> 64-bit <code>time_t</code> (<i>ahem Linux</i>) are still problematic.  (See unlike WinY2K, most of these system are embedded and actually run <i>important</i> software)</li>

          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Ignore the leap second and have NTP slowly 'catch up' the system later - but this takes up to 2 days to get back to millisecond clock accuracy (especially bad for clusters)</li>
            <li class="fragment">Slew the clock so that it is slowed over the course of 10s or 100s of seconds just before midnight (your clock is 'wrong' for longer)</li>
            <li class="fragment">Change your NTP servers to 'smear' the time change in their served time. Clients won't know the difference (need to run your own private NTP servers)</li>
            <li class="fragment">When all else fails, just turn it off and then turn it on (often the simplest and safest)<span class="fragment"> - optionally let your customers know in advance!</span></li>
