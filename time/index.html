          <h2>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC for short, obviously)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">The English wanted coordinated universal time (<strong>CUT</strong>) but the French wanted temps universal coodonné (<strong>TUC</strong>)</li>
            <li class="fragment">Instead of doing the sensible thing and fighting a war over it they did something far worse: <span class="fragment">Invent the <i>"Three Letter Anagram"</i></span></li>

          <h2>What is UTC?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">UTC is meant to be the exact "Human Time" or wallclock time for the world, providing a perfectly ordered and predictable model of time</li>
            <li class="fragment">...while at they same time papering over the fact that the Earth's rotation is slowing and the Earth's orbit is decaying</li>
            <li class="fragment">In short it follows the UNIX™ philosphy: 90% simplicity, 10% PIA</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintaining UTC requires constant measurement and tuning to ensure that the Sun rises at the same time each day (currently 1.3ms/day on average)</li>
            <li class="fragment">As a result of these corrections it is not possible to determine the exact time interval between two UTC datetimes without consulting lookup tables</li>
            <li class="fragment">By the 22nd century it is estismated that two leap second corrections will be needed per year, and by the 25th, 4 seconds!</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Meet TAI Time, UTC's close but soon to be distant cousin</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Temps Atomique International (the French won this time...)</li>

        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>TAI time was last exactly synchronized with UTC back in 1958 but since then has drifted due to the changing motion of the Earth</li>
            <li class="fragment">Currently TAI time is exactly 36 seconds ahead of UTC</li>

          <h2>TAI Trivia</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Atomic clock services first started in 1955</li>
            <li class="fragment">In 1967 the SI Second was defined in terms of the Cæsium atom as 9,192,631,770 periods of radiation</li>
            <li class="fragment">Due to differential gravitational time dilation at different altitudes, the various Cæsium clocks would tick at slightly different rates, which had to be corrected by averaging and applying corrections to bring the calculated time to mean sea level!</li>

          <h2>Unix Time Representation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Unix Epoch was chosen to be Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC (funny thing because UTC didn't exist until 1972!)</li>
            <li class="fragment">Positive integers represent seconds elapsed since the Epoch (an outright lie), negative for times before</li>
            <li class="fragment">...and there are 86400 seconds in day. <i>Always</i> (your definition of a second may have to stretch a little)</li>
            <li class="fragment"><i>The Unix Time Truth</i>: Unix time is actually the number of calendar days since the epoch multipled by 86400, then add the number of seconds since midnight</li>
            <li class="fragment">There is no concept of time zones, Unix time is always relative to UTC+0, but conversion into local time is easy provided you know your offset</li>
          </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>The History of (Unix) Time</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">Originally Unix time was a <code>long</code> integer... that incremented at a rate of 60 Hz</li>
          <li class="fragment">The "Unix Programmer's Manual" from 1971 stated that the <i>"chronologically-minded user will note that 2<sup>32</sup> sixtieths of a second, or 2<sup>38</sup> seconds is only about 8.5 years"</i></li>
          <li class="fragment">In order to extend the range they decided to drop the 60 ticks per second and move to a single tick per second</li>
          <li class="fragment">As a result the "chronologically-minded" greybeards decided that while 8.5 years would be a trainwreck, 68 years ensured that they would be long gone before having to clean up their mess!</li>

        <h2>The</h2><code>0b01111111111111111111111111111111</code><h2>Problem</h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Internally <code>time_t</code> is a signed 32-bit integer which will overflow on Monday January 18, 2038 at 22:14:08 EST (talk about a bad start to the week!)</li>
          <li class="fragment">In order to mitigate this, most modern 64-bit system use <code>time_t</code> that is a signed 64 bit integer that will overflow some time after the heat death of the universe (<i>hopefully we'll have moved to another one by then!</i>)</li>
          <li class="fragment">In <i>2014</i>, OpenBSD 5.5 was the first major operating system to convert to 64-bit <code>time_t</code> for all versions of its operating system, including those that run on 32-bit archs</li>
          <li class="fragment">However existing 8, 16, and 32-bit systems, as well as new ones deployed <i>without</i> 64-bit <code>time_t</code> (<i>ahem Linux</i>) are still problematic.  (See unlike WinY2K, most of these system are embedded and actually run <i>important</i> software)</li>

          <h2>Temporal Reality</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>As a result of this unpredictibility, leap second changes are published only 6 months in advance</li>
            <li class="fragment">By convention, leap seconds are only inserted or removed at the end of June 30 or December 31</li>
            <li class="fragment">However in theory they can occur at the end of any month according to the UTC standard (think 'Apocalypse' if it came to that)</li>

        <section>
          <h2>Temporal Fantasy</h2>

            <li class="fragment">According to the POSIX standard, there are exactly 86400 seconds in a day</li>

            <li class="fragment">Slew the clock so that it is slowed over the course of 10s or 100s of seconds just before midnight (your clock is 'wrong' for longer)</li>
            <li class="fragment">Change your NTP servers to 'smear' the time change in their served time. Clients won't know the difference (need to run your own private NTP servers)</li>
            <li class="fragment">When all else fails, just turn it off and then turn it on (often the simplest and safest)<span class="fragment"> - optionally let your customers know in advance!</span></li>
